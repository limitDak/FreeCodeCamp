            <p class = "text-center">The Sootopolis Gym specializes in the most abundant Pokemon type on the planet, Water! Water-types are majestic, flowing beings
                that can be found on any region in a vast array of shapes, colors, and personalities. They are capable, strong Pokemon with the power
                to douse raging fires and bring life to deserted wastelands. It is no coincidence that water-types are a staple for any serious trainer's team!

                trainer now must defeat Wallace and his former master Juan in order to receive the Sootopolis City Badge, aka the Rain Badge. Both Leaders are frighteningly
                strong, both bringing forth powerful water-type teams of their own. They without a doubt represent the best of the best when it comes to water-type trainers region-wide.
