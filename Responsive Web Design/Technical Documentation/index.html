                <h3>What is this web page?</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello! I've dedicated this web page to be my (Dakota) technical documentation page. This page is
                    based off the ruleset
                    that Jan has made for his <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J15ihcAWkfF237gh8KRP871lqDVTFPkvYBGh4I8xQsM/edit#">Hardcore
                        Nuzlockes</a> which you can check out yourself if you'd like.
                    I take
                    <strong>no credit whatsoever in the making of this documentation</strong> besides formatting it for
                    this website. That being said, I have some additional tips and tools following the documentation
                    which you can check out as well. Hope you enjoy!
                </p>
                <h3>What is this documentation?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the ruleset I personally use in my Hardcore Nuzlockes that I do on my stream at
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemonchallenges">twitch.tv/PokemonChallenges</a>.
                    To
                    me this represents the perfect balance of challenge and fun, of random and skill elements. This is
                    in no
                    way the be all
                    end all of challenge runs and there are definitely some downsides to this ruleset. It requires a lot
                    of
                    experience as a
                    Nuzlocker, and I do not recommend using this ruleset as your very first Nuzlocke challenge. <br><br>
                    Additionally, this ruleset usually requires quite a lot of grinding before gym battles. However, I
                    still
                    believe them to
                    be the baseline for one of the most fun ways ever to play a Pokémon game and I hope you give it a
                    try.
                    <br><br>

                <h3>1.1 Basic Rules of Obtaining Pokemon</h3>
                <p>
                    Only the first Pokémon I encounter in a specific area may be caught. The area a Pokémon was caught
                    in is
                    defined by the
                    "Met on:" text in its Summary. This includes Pokémon hatched from eggs. Their “Met on:” will display
                    the
                    area they
                    hatched in, making it possible to acquire encounters in places where it is usually not possible to
                    encounter a Pokémon
                    (e.g. in a city). <br><br>
                    If the first encounter in an area is killed off in battle, the encounter may not be rerolled (a
                    reroll
                    is considered
                    another chance at an encounter while ignoring and not catching the previous one). <br><br>
                    These rules apply as soon as I am first <strong>able</strong> to encounter and catch a Pokémon. For
                    example,
                    Pokémon I encounter in tall
                    grass before I am able to receive Poké Balls do not count as my first encounter of the Route.
                </p>
                <h3>1.2 Methods of Encountering Pokemon</h3>
                <p>
                    I may choose the method of acquiring the encounter freely. Fishing, surfing, grass, hordes, Rock
                    Smash,
                    honey, Headbutt,
                    etc. are all considered legitimate. The exceptions to this are DexNav, shaking grass and Pokémon
                    obtained in an SOS
                    chain started on the first legal encounter of the route (and all equivalents thereof).<br><br>
                    A gift Pokémon is considered a legitimate encounter and will be treated as such. I may
                    <strong>not</strong> encounter another Pokémon
                    after receiving one as a gift.
                </p>
                <h3>1.3 Manipulating Encounters</h3>
                <p>
                    I may freely choose my starter or any other gift Pokémon that has multiple options (Casino,
                    etc.).<br><br>
                    If the first encounter on a route is a double battle or horde encounter, the Pokémon I can catch in
                    that
                    battle may be
                    chosen by me.<br><br>
                    Repelling in an area to get a certain encounter (high level, different floor, roaming, or static
                    encounter) is allowed.
                </p>
                <h3>1.4 Additional and Illegitimate Encounters</h3>
                <p>
                    Trading with NPCs is allowed and not considered an encounter. I may trade with NPCs in areas that I
                    have
                    previously
                    received an encounter in or plan to acquire an encounter in.<br><br>
                    If I, at any point, encounter a shiny Pokémon during the run, I <em>may</em> catch that Pokémon. If
                    I
                    already
                    have a Pokémon of
                    the same species I may <strong>choose</strong> to replace it with the shiny Pokémon (Shiny Clause).
                    If
                    the first
                    encounter on a route is
                    a shiny Pokémon, I do not get an additional encounter. I explain my reasoning for this rule in this
                    clip: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/988782855">Shiny Clause</a>.<br><br>
                    I may not use two Pokémon of the same species or evolution line (Species Clause). If the first
                    encounter
                    of a Route
                    belongs to an evolution line of a Pokémon that I have already received as an encounter in that run,
                    the
                    encounter on
                    that route may be rerolled until I encounter a Pokémon that I may use. If there are no Pokémon in
                    the
                    area that belong
                    to an evolution line I have not previously caught, I don’t get an encounter in that area. Species
                    Clause
                    persists after
                    death (e.g. if I encounter a Zubat after losing my Crobat, I may not catch the Zubat).<br><br>
                    I may decide to ban usage of certain Pokémon depending on the game I am currently playing. For
                    example,
                    Blissey and
                    Salamence are Pokémon I will usually not use, as they make gameplay too easy for my taste. If I
                    encounter a banned
                    Pokémon, I may reroll my encounter for that area. However, a Pokémon from the same evolution line as
                    a
                    banned Pokémon
                    will count as my encounter and I may use it (e.g. I may catch Shelgon, but not evolve it to
                    Salamence).<br><br>
                    As a general rule of thumb, I ban legendary and mythical Pokémon, as well as Mega evolved forms. For
                    some pointers on
                    Pokémon I have previously banned on playthroughs see my outdated ban list: <a target="_blank"

                <h3>2.1 Basic Conditions for Death</h3>
                <p>
                    If at any point the HP of one of my Pokémon is reduced to 0 that Pokémon is considered dead and may
                    no
                    longer be used. I
                    <strong>must</strong> permanently put the Pokémon into the PC as soon as possible. I may not take a
                    dead
                    Pokémon out of the PC (unless in
                    the highly specific cases detailed below).
                </p>
                <h3 id="hm_mules">2.2 HM Mules and Forced Reviving</h3>
                <p>
                    If I need to use a certain HM to progress in the game and none of my alive Pokémon are able to learn
                    it,
                    I may pick up a
                    dead Pokémon from the PC for the sole purpose of teaching it the required HM. This does not include
                    moves like Flash,
                    Thief for stealing Items or using Sweet Scent for hordes. An exception may be made for HM Fly, as it
                    raises the quality
                    of the content I make.<br><br>
                    I may catch an additional HM mule if I have no Pokémon dead or alive that can help me
                    progress.<br><br>
                    If I end up in a situation where a dead Pokémon or an HM mule is put into battle, I must switch into
                    a
                    living Pokémon
                    immediately. I may not use the moves Assist or Beat Up (or any mechanically similar moves) while I
                    have
                    a revived
                    Pokémon or HM mule on my team. If a dead Pokémon or an HM mule is put into battle and cannot switch
                    out
                    (for example due
                    to the effects of Arena Trap, Mean Look, or variations thereof), this is considered breaking the
                    rules.

                <h3>3.1 Basic Rules for Level Caps</h3>
                <p>
                    Any Pokémon I use for battle may not exceed the next gym leader's highest levelled Pokémon in level.
                    This applies
                    exactly until the gym battle is <strong>initiated</strong>, so over-levelling
                    <strong>during</strong> a
                    gym fight is allowed.<br><br>
                    The level cap for the Elite Four is to be determined by me. A good starting point is the last Elite
                    Four
                    member’s
                    highest levelled Pokémon. The level cap is in effect until I initiate the first Elite Four battle. I
                    may
                    not use any
                    rare candies after initiating the Elite Four gauntlet.

                </p>
                <h3>3.2 Exceeding the Level Cap</h3>
                <p>
                    If a Pokémon <em>does</em> over-level under any other circumstances not specified above or I catch
                    an
                    over-levelled Pokémon, it
                    is considered dead until I beat the gym that unlocks its level. An over-levelled Pokémon must be put
                    into the PC as soon
                    as possible and may not be taken out (except to use it as an HM mule as specified in <a
                        href="#hm_mules">2.2. HM Mules and
                        Forced Reviving</a>).<br><br>
                    A Pokémon that exceeds its level cap during a battle or is brought into battle through
                    Roar/Whirlwind/Dragon Tail etc.
                    must be switched out immediately. I may not use the moves Assist or Beat Up (or any mechanically
                    similar
                    moves) with an
                    over-levelled Pokémon on my team. If an over-levelled Pokémon is put into battle and cannot switch
                    out
                    (for example due
                    to the effects of Arena Trap, Mean Look, or variations thereof), this is considered breaking the
                    rules.
                    See <a href="#rule_breaking">6.2 Rule
                        Breaking</a> for more information.<br><br>
                    If at any point all my Pokémon are above the level cap, the run is considered dead and I must
                    restart.

            <article>
                <p>
                    The run is considered lost when I lose a party of Pokémon and enter the white out screen. This
                    applies
                    even if I have
                    other Pokémon left in the PC.<br><br>
                    In a tag battle with an AI partner it is possible to lose all 3 Pokémon I brought to the battle, but
                    still win the fight
                    because my AI partner managed to beat the opponent(s). In this case I do not enter a white out
                    screen
                    and the run is not
                    considered dead. Only the three Pokémon I lost during the tag battle are considered dead.<br><br>
                    In Sky Battles (Generation 6) it is possible to lose the battle without entering a white out screen:
                    The
                    opponent can
                    knock out all my Pokémon eligible to participate in a Sky Battle, but I still carry other Pokémon
                    with
                    me. In this case
                    the run will not be considered dead, only the Pokémon I lost during the Sky Battle are considered
                    dead.

                <h3>6.1 Crashes</h3>
                <p>In case of an emulator or console crash I must reload the last save and the following rules apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All encounters I have gotten between the save point and crash are considered lost and may not be
                        rerolled.</li>
                    <li>Any Pokémon that died between the last save point and crash are still considered dead.</li>
                    <li>I may re-battle any required trainer battle that I have beaten between save point and crash. I
                        may
                        use any method I see
                        fit to clear this battle (using dead Pokémon, modifying the save etc.). Any Pokémon that faints
                        during such a re-battle
                        is not considered dead.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="rule_breaking">6.2 Rule Breaking</h3>
                <p>
                    If at any point I break one of these rules on accident (or purpose), the standard punishment is to
                    reload at the last
                    save point and kill off the Pokémon that might have been saved by said rule violation.

                <h3>7.1 Pokelink</h3>
                <p>Pokelink is an <strong>extremely</strong> useful tool when it comes to playing Nuzlockes. It allows
                    you to keep track of what encounters
                    you have had so far, the current status of your team, the basic metadata for your party Pokemon
                    (Nature, EV's, IV's, etc.) and can even start your
                    emulator with the correct game! I highly recommend this program if you have trouble keeping track of
                    your info during your Nuzlocke.
                </p>
                <h3>7.2 General Tips</h3>
                <p>Some general tips that will help you on your Nuzlocke journey that you might overlook:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check your party's status before going into a fight. It's not uncommon that you'll forget to
                        heal and end up losing a team member
                        for a reason that you could have prevented.
                    </li>
                    <li>It never hurts to check up on trainer teams for a given route, <strong>especially</strong> when
                        you're playing a game like
                        Emerald Kaizo. Having the advantage of knowing the opponent's team can be the way to victory.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always equip held items before a major battle! Even if it may seem pointless to add a Oran or
                        Sitrus Berry,
                        it's better than that Pokemon not having a held item at all!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>7.3 Cheat Codes</h3>
                <p>It's not uncommon to use cheat codes for Nuzlockes, especially for berries. Since the internal
                    clock doesn't work for the GBA emulators,
                    it's impossible to acquire new berries naturally. On top of that, berries are also tedious to
                    acquire, so I have listed a few cheat codes (specifically for Emerald) for some of the most common
                    berries.<br><br>
                    In order to use the codes, enter the code 82005274 0YYY and replace YYY with item digits. Then go to
                    the
                    Poke Mart and purchase the first item in the buy list.
                    The first item is your chosen berry.<br><br>

                    <strong>Example:</strong> Enter code 82005274 0085 for Cheri berry.
                </p>
                <code>085 – Cheri Berry</code>
                <code>086 – Chesto Berry</code>
                <code>087 – Pecha Berry</code>
                <code>08E – Sitrus Berry</code>
                <code>08D – Lum Berry</code>
